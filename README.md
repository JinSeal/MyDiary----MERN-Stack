# Secret Dairy

This is a simply diary built with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js, styled with Reactstrap, and backed with Redux and rich text editor.
The site is deployed via Heroku at: https://secret-diary.herokuapp.com.

I wrote the site to practice the MERN stack and Redux. All functions are stored in Redux. This app is responsive.

## Directory Layout

- `client`: React application
- `middleware`: JWT config
- `model`: Diary and User models
- `routes`: server side routes

## Access Control
- User can only view, create, edit and delete diary after login.

## Encryption (coming)
- Diaries are encrypted with secret key generated by encrypted user password.
- Traffic are secured with heroku SSL.

## Potential Improvements
- Encrypt data deeper
- Better UI
- CI/CD
